# tetris


This project is an ASCII based tetris game that I built during a programming class, when I should have been doing my programming assignments. This version of tetris was modeled after Tetris: The grand master (TGM) by Arika.

This is going to be windows specific as I had to use some windows specific functions for controling cursor position to simulate a "rastering" of the screen.
